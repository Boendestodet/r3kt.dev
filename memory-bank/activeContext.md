# Active Context: Lovable Clone

## Current Status
The project is in **initialization phase** with the memory bank being established. The application appears to be a fully functional Laravel + React application with comprehensive features already implemented.

## Recent Discoveries
- **Project Type**: AI-powered website builder (Lovable clone)
- **Tech Stack**: Laravel 12 + React 19 + Inertia.js v2 + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: MySQL with well-defined models (User, Project, Prompt, Comment, Container)
- **Testing**: Pest v4 with comprehensive test coverage
- **UI Components**: Modern component library with Radix UI and Headless UI
- **Project Generation**: Now generates Next.js projects instead of static HTML
- **Docker Support**: Full Next.js containerization with proper port mapping

## Current Work Focus
- **Next.js Integration**: Successfully converted project generation from HTML to Next.js
- **Docker Support**: Updated Docker containerization to support Next.js projects
- **Testing**: Fixed failing tests and ensured comprehensive test coverage

## Key Findings

### Existing Features
Based on the README and project structure, the application includes:
- ✅ User authentication and project management
- ✅ AI-powered website generation with multiple types
- ✅ Project CRUD operations with status tracking
- ✅ Modern UI with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with Pest v4
- ✅ Docker container management (mocked)

### Project Structure
- **Backend**: Well-organized Laravel 12 application with services, policies, and jobs
- **Frontend**: Modern React 19 setup with TypeScript and component-based architecture
- **Database**: MySQL with proper relationships and migrations
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with feature and unit tests

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating all core memory bank files
2. **Code Analysis**: Deep dive into existing code to understand implementation patterns
3. **Feature Assessment**: Evaluate current features and identify potential improvements
4. **Development Setup**: Ensure development environment is properly configured

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Structure
- Following the established pattern with 6 core files
- Focus on capturing current state and patterns
- Emphasis on Laravel + React integration patterns

### Documentation Approach
- Comprehensive coverage of technical stack
- Clear separation of concerns between files
- Focus on practical implementation details

## Current Considerations

### Technical Debt
- Need to analyze existing code for potential improvements
- Evaluate test coverage and identify gaps
- Review performance optimizations

### Feature Gaps
- Real AI API integration (currently mocked)
- Actual Docker container management
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced customization options

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Linux 6.8.12-4-pve
- **Shell**: /bin/bash
- **Workspace**: /var/www/r3kt.dev/public_html
- **PHP**: 8.3.24
- **Laravel**: 12.26.4
- **Node.js**: Available for frontend development

## Immediate Priorities
1. Complete memory bank initialization
2. Analyze existing codebase patterns
3. Identify development opportunities
4. Establish development workflow
