# Project Brief: Lovable Clone - AI-Powered Website Builder

## Project Overview
This is a production-ready Laravel-based clone of Lovable, an AI-powered web development platform that allows users to build websites using natural language prompts. The project features multi-AI provider integration (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Cursor CLI), smart cost optimization, real Docker container management with live previews, comprehensive multi-stack support, and real-time collaboration features. Built with modern full-stack development practices using Laravel 12, React 19, and Inertia.js v2.

## Core Purpose
Create a platform where users can:
- Generate websites using natural language descriptions
- Manage multiple projects with different website types
- Preview and customize generated websites
- Share and collaborate on projects

## Key Requirements
1. **User Management**: Authentication, project ownership, privacy controls
2. **AI Website Generation**: Process natural language prompts to generate appropriate website types
3. **Project Management**: CRUD operations, status tracking, code storage
4. **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive design with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4
5. **Live Preview System**: Real Docker container management with Next.js development server
6. **Real-time Features**: Live preview, status updates, collaboration
