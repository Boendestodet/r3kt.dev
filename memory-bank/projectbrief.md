# Project Brief: Lovable Clone - AI-Powered Website Builder

## Project Overview
This is a Laravel-based clone of Lovable, an AI-powered web development platform that allows users to build websites using natural language prompts. The project demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with Laravel 12, React 19, and Inertia.js v2.

## Core Purpose
Create a platform where users can:
- Generate websites using natural language descriptions
- Manage multiple projects with different website types
- Preview and customize generated websites
- Share and collaborate on projects

## Key Requirements
1. **User Management**: Authentication, project ownership, privacy controls
2. **AI Website Generation**: Process natural language prompts to generate appropriate website types
3. **Project Management**: CRUD operations, status tracking, code storage
4. **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive design with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4
5. **Real-time Features**: Live preview, status updates, collaboration

## Success Criteria
- Users can create accounts and manage projects
- AI can intelligently detect website types from prompts
- Generated websites are functional and visually appealing
- Platform supports multiple website types (Portfolio, E-commerce, Blog, Landing Page, Dashboard)
- Code is well-tested and maintainable

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Laravel 12 with PHP 8.3
- Frontend must use React 19 with TypeScript
- Styling with Tailwind CSS v4
- Database: MySQL with Eloquent ORM
- Testing: Pest v4 for comprehensive coverage
- Build: Vite for asset bundling

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**: Core website generation, project management, user authentication, modern UI
- **Out of Scope**: Real AI API integration (currently mocked), actual Docker deployment, payment processing

## Target Users
- Web developers looking for rapid prototyping
- Non-technical users wanting to build websites
- Students learning web development
- Small businesses needing quick website solutions
