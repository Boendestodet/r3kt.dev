# Progress: Lovable Clone

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Core Infrastructure
- **Laravel 12 Application**: Fully configured with modern structure
- **React 19 Frontend**: TypeScript setup with Inertia.js v2 integration
- **Database Schema**: Complete with all necessary models and relationships
- **Authentication System**: User registration and login functionality
- **Testing Framework**: Pest v4 with comprehensive test coverage

### User Management
- User registration and authentication
- Project ownership and privacy controls
- User-specific project management

### Project Management System
- Project CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Project duplication and sharing capabilities
- Project status tracking (Draft, Building, Ready, Error)
- Generated code storage and management

### AI Website Generation
- Natural language prompt processing
- Intelligent website type detection
- Next.js project generation with full project structure
- Multiple website templates:
  - Portfolio websites
  - E-commerce sites
  - Blog platforms
  - Landing pages
  - Dashboard interfaces
  - Generic websites
- Complete Next.js project files (package.json, tsconfig.json, app structure)
- Docker containerization for Next.js projects

### Modern UI/UX
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Responsive design for all devices
- Modern component library (Radix UI, Headless UI)
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Development Tools
- Vite for asset bundling and HMR
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Laravel Pint for PHP code formatting
- Comprehensive development scripts

## What's Left to Build üöß

### Real AI Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Current State**: ‚úÖ Fully integrated with OpenAI and Claude AI
- **Features**: Multi-provider system with intelligent fallback
- **Cost Optimization**: Claude tried first (3.7x cheaper than OpenAI)
- **Reliability**: Graceful fallback to mock generation if both fail

### Docker Container Management
- **Current State**: Mocked container lifecycle
- **Needed**: Real Docker integration for live previews
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: High

### Real-time Features
- **Current State**: Basic functionality
- **Needed**: Live collaboration, real-time updates
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: High

### Advanced Customization
- **Current State**: Basic template selection
- **Needed**: Advanced customization options
- **Priority**: Low
- **Effort**: Medium

### Deployment & Hosting
- **Current State**: Development only
- **Needed**: Production deployment pipeline
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: High
