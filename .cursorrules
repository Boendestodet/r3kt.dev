# Lovable Clone - AI-Powered Website Builder

## Project Overview
This is a Laravel 12 + React 19 application that clones Lovable's AI-powered website builder. Users can generate websites using natural language prompts, with intelligent detection of website types and modern UI/UX.

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Inertia.js v2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Testing**: Pest v4
- **Build**: Vite

## Development Patterns

### Laravel Patterns
- Use Eloquent relationships over raw queries
- Implement Form Request classes for validation
- Use Policies for authorization
- Follow Laravel 12 streamlined structure (no middleware files, bootstrap/app.php for configuration)

### React Patterns
- Component-based architecture with TypeScript
- Use Inertia.js for navigation and forms
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow React 19 best practices

### Database Patterns
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Implement proper relationships between models
- Use factories for test data generation
- Follow naming conventions (lowercase folder names)

## Project Structure
- **Models**: User, Project, Prompt, Comment, Container
- **Services**: AIWebsiteGeneratorService, ProjectService, ContainerService
- **Frontend**: Pages, Components, Layouts, Hooks
- **Testing**: Feature tests for user flows, unit tests for business logic

## Key Features
- AI-powered website generation with multiple types
- Project management with CRUD operations
- User authentication and authorization
- Modern responsive UI with Tailwind CSS v4
- Comprehensive testing with Pest v4

## Development Guidelines
- Always write tests for new features
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods
- Follow existing code conventions
- Use Laravel Boost tools for development
- Maintain memory bank documentation

## Current Status
- Core platform is 90% complete
- AI integration is mocked (needs real API)
- Real-time features are minimal
- Memory bank is being established
