# Lovable Clone - AI-Powered Website Builder

## Project Overview
This is a Laravel 12 + React 19 application that clones Lovable's AI-powered website builder. Users can generate websites using natural language prompts, with intelligent detection of website types and modern UI/UX.

## Key Technologies
- **Backend**: Laravel 12, PHP 8.3, MySQL
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Inertia.js v2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Testing**: Pest v4
- **Build**: Vite

## Development Patterns

### Laravel Patterns
- Use Eloquent relationships over raw queries
- Implement Form Request classes for validation
- Use Policies for authorization
- Follow Laravel 12 streamlined structure (no middleware files, bootstrap/app.php for configuration)

### React Patterns
- Component-based architecture with TypeScript
- Use Inertia.js for navigation and forms
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow React 19 best practices

### Database Patterns
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Implement proper relationships between models
- Use factories for test data generation
- Follow naming conventions (lowercase folder names)

## Project Structure
- **Models**: User, Project, Prompt, Comment, Container
- **Services**: AIWebsiteGeneratorService, ProjectService, ContainerService
- **Frontend**: Pages, Components, Layouts, Hooks
- **Testing**: Feature tests for user flows, unit tests for business logic

## Key Features
- AI-powered website generation with multiple types
- Project management with CRUD operations
- User authentication and authorization
- Modern responsive UI with Tailwind CSS v4
- Comprehensive testing with Pest v4

## Development Guidelines
- Always write tests for new features
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods
- Follow existing code conventions
- Use Laravel Boost tools for development
- Maintain memory bank documentation

## Current Status
- Core platform is 100% complete
- AI integration is fully functional with dual providers (OpenAI + Claude)
- Docker container management with live previews is working
- Project creation flow is complete with verification and progress tracking
- File creation logic fixed (Next.js-only files, no duplicate HTML)
- Container start timing issues resolved
- Memory bank is complete and up-to-date

## Recent Fixes
- **File Creation Logic**: Fixed issue where both HTML and Next.js files were being created - now only creates appropriate files based on project type
- **Container Start Issue**: Fixed container start failure due to missing generated_code by improving AI generation waiting logic
- **AI Generation Timing**: Fixed timing issue where frontend was not properly waiting for AI generation to complete

## Development Patterns
- **File Type Detection**: Always check project settings to determine file type before creating files
- **AI Generation Waiting**: Always wait for AI generation to complete before starting containers
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- **Project Type Logic**: Use project settings to determine appropriate file creation strategy
